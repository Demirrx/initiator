 * This (functions.php) template file should only do three jobs, one is to check the compatibility if the site meets
 * the miminum requirements before the theme proceeds to activate. The second job is to autoload the backdrop core
 * famework. The last job is to require the theme's framework so that it can add additional features if the backdrop
 * core doesn't come with features the theme needs.
